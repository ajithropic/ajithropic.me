# Codex Notes - ajithropic.me

Static site generator for personal portfolio using Python (Jinja2, Mistune) and Tailwind CSS.

## Working Rules

- Rebuild the preview every time you finish a change before responding.
- After rebuilding, tell the user what to refresh and which page to inspect.
- Edit source files in `src/` and `public/`, not generated files in `dist/`.
- Keep writing natural and understated. Do not make pages feel braggy or corporate.
- When adding fun pages under `~/random.md`, optimize for personality, interactivity, and easy future edits.
- On homepage changes, check both desktop and mobile behavior.

## Preferred Rebuild Commands

```bash
uv run python src/build.py --output dist
pnpm tailwindcss -i ./src/index.css -o ./dist/index.css --minify
```

## Dev Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Repo Structure

- `src/build.py` - static site generator
- `src/templates/` - Jinja2 templates
- `src/templates/random/` - custom fun pages
- `src/index.css` - Tailwind source
- `public/` - static assets
- `dist/` - generated output

## Current Preferences

- The `whoami` image should stack below text on mobile and float right on larger screens.
- `~/random.md` contains the life motto plus large left-aligned buttons.
- Random pages should feel intentional and playful, not generic.
- `wins.md` should stay understated and shelf-like rather than sounding like a brag sheet.
